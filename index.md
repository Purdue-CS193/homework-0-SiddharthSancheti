# Siddharth Sancheti's First CS193 Homework

Here are some of my favorite things about CS193:
- The class is hella chill.
- The instructors are students like us, so they get our struggles.
- I have friends taking this class.
- This class actually teaches me skills relavent to my field which I will be using in the workforce.

This is an example of an italisized statement:
_The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog._

This is an example of a bolded statement:
**I love Purdue's CS193 class! Please give me an A now.**

My favorite things in the world:
1. My mom
2. My bed
3. Money
